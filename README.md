# Plugin for SourceMod developers
## About

Here the new API docs with all (I hope) function, define, enum, methodmap and fixed xml structure. Docs were generated by reworked generator plugin.

## Plugin features:
 - Generate auto-completion files
 - Generate inline docs (*sourcemod.xml*)
 - Supports SourceMod 1.7 API specifics
 
## New in v1.2:
 - Added xml filter
 - Added more console stats
 - Better way to detect commentary lines
 - Code optimization
 - Detect methodmap
 - Detect enum & define correctly
 - Detect all func params

## Server command:
**sm_makedocs** - starts to parse SourceMod includes and generates output files

## Methodmap notes:
Notepad++ don't reacts on dots in names (exp: LineNumber.get) and docs not shown, so I replaced . with _ symbol

This strings are not SourceMod function! Purpose of this strings provide access to docs and show methodmap structure.
If you want to use it as code you must remove prefix and separate _ with .
If you want to watch docs you must do the vice versa 

### Prefix structure:

PREFIX - All text before Method/Property/Constructor name

**With Tag:**  
METHODMAP_%1_%2_METHOD_%3  
METHODMAP_%1_%2_PROP_%3

**Without Tag:**  
METHODMAP_%1_METHOD_%3  
METHODMAP_%1_PROP_%3

**Where:**  
%1 - Class name  
%2 - Tag name  
%3 - Method/Property/Constructor name

### Examples:

**String to watch docs:**  
Method: Clone  
Prefix: METHODMAP_ArrayList_Handle_METHOD_  
Result: METHODMAP_ArrayList_Handle_METHOD_Clone

**String to use as code:**  
Docs: METHODMAP_ArrayStack_PROP_BlockSize_get  
Result: my_code.BlockSize.get()
