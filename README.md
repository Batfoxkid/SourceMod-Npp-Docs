Here the new API docs with all (I hope) function, define, enum, methodmap and fixed xml structure. Docs were generated by reworked generator plugin.

# Plugin

### Features:
 - Generate auto-completion files.
 - Generate inline docs (*sourcemod.xml*).
 - Supports SourceMod 1.7 API specifics.
 
### New in v1.2:
 - Added better way to detect commentary.
 - Added methods docs (*Still in progress...*).
 - Added more console stats.
 - Added xml filter.
 - Code optimization.
 - Detect all func params.
 - Detect enum & define correctly.
 - Detect methodmap selection.
 - Makes keywords to pop up correctly.

 
### Server command:
**sm_makedocs** - starts to parse SourceMod includes and generates output files.

# Notepad++

## Autocompletion
API files are located in the **plugins\APIs\\** subfolder of the Notepad++ installation folder. Use **sm_makedocs** command to generate docs. Files will be created in the **plugins\NPP\\** subfolder of sourcemod folder. Copy **sourcemod.xm**l file to Notepad++ API folder. The completion list can be triggered automatically as you type, via settings in **Settings -> Preferences -> Auto-Completion:** Auto-Completion is enabled by a checkbox. Additionally there is a setting "From X th character", accepting a the minimum length of a prefix needed before the completion list is shown (some people like 2, some 3, some 4...); and, there is a setting to specify which candidates should be used: words, functions, or both.

## Highlights
Check **plugins\NPP\\** folder for **NPP_STYLE** files. These files contain defining the keyword lists for the SourcePawn language. Open one of those files, select keywords and copy. Go to **Notepd++ -> Lanuguage -> Define your language...** Create new/update your language and past keywords to the Keywords Lists group. Do it for other groups too. Configurate you own style: color, font, etc... Read more about [UDL 2.0](https://udl20.weebly.com/index.html)

# Methodmap notes
![Docs screenshot](https://github.com/raziEiL/SourceMod-Npp-Docs/blob/master/img/docs%20list.png "Inline docs: methodmap strings")  
These strings are not exist SourceMod function! Purpose of these strings provide access to docs and show methodmap structure. Notepad++ don't reacts on dots in names (exp: fileArray.GetString) and docs not shown, so `.` were separated with `_` symbol.
>**Note:** If you want to use string as code you must remove prefix and separate `_` with `.`  
>**Note:** If you want to watch docs you must do the vice versa.

## Prefix structure:

| MM (Methodmap) type | With tag | Without tag |
|------| ------ | ------ |
| C (Constructor) | MM_`%1`_`%2`\_C\_`%3` | MM_`%1`\_C_`%3` |
| M (Method) | MM_`%1`_`%2`_M\_`%3` | MM_`%1`\_M_`%3` |
| P (Property) | MM_`%1`_`%2`_P\_`%3` | MM_`%1`_P\_`%3` |

Where: `%1` - Class name, `%2` - Tag name, `%3` - Real method/property/constructor name.
>**Note:** **Prefix** - a string before `%3` param (e.g., `MM_ArrayList_Handle_M_`GetArray).

## Examples:

| MM (Methodmap) type | With tag                   | Without tag                |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| C (Constructor)     | MM_Menu_Handle_C_Menu      | Always has the tag         |
| M (Method)          | MM_Menu_Handle_M_ToPanel   | MM_AdminId_M_BindIdentity  |
| P (Property)        | MM_Menu_Handle_P_ItemCount | MM_AdminId_P_ImmunityLevel |

**Editing string to watch docs:**  
Method: ToPanel()  
Prefix: MM_Menu_Handle_M_  
Result: MM_Menu_Handle_M_ToPanel

**Editing string to use as code:**  
Docs string: MM_AdminId_P_ImmunityLevel  
Removes prefix: MM_AdminId_M_  
Result: my_code.ImmunityLevel()
