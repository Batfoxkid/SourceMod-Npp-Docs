Here the new API docs with all (I hope) function, define, enum, methodmap and fixed xml structure. Docs were generated by reworked generator plugin.

# Plugin

### Features:
 - Generate auto-completion files.
 - Generate inline docs (*sourcemod.xml*).
 - Supports SourceMod 1.7 API specifics.
 
### New in v1.2:
 - Added xml filter.
 - Added more console stats.
 - Better way to detect commentary lines.
 - Code optimization.
 - Detect methodmap.
 - Detect enum & define correctly.
 - Detect all func params.
 - Makes keywords to pop up correctly
 
### Server command:
**sm_makedocs** - starts to parse SourceMod includes and generates output files.

# Notepad

## Autocompletion
API files are located in the **plugins\APIs\\** subfolder of the Notepad++ installation folder. Use **sm_makedocs** command to generate docs. Files will be created in the **plugins\NPP\\** subfolder of sourcemod folder. Copy **sourcemod.xm**l file to Notepad++ API folder. The completion list can be triggered automatically as you type, via settings in **Settings -> Preferences -> Auto-Completion:** Auto-Completion is enabled by a checkbox. Additionally there is a setting "From X th character", accepting a the minimum length of a prefix needed before the completion list is shown (some people like 2, some 3, some 4...); and, there is a setting to specify which candidates should be used: words, functions, or both.

## Highlights
Check **plugins\NPP\\** folder for **NPP_STYLE** files. These files contain defining the keyword lists for the SourcePawn language. Open one of those files, select keywords and copy. Go to **Notepd++ -> Lanuguage -> Define your language...** Create new language and past keywords to the Keywords Lists group. Configurate you own style.

# Methodmap notes
![Docs screenshot](https://github.com/raziEiL/SourceMod-Npp-Docs/blob/master/img/docs%20list.png "Inline docs: methodmap strings")  
These strings are not exist SourceMod function! Purpose of these strings provide access to docs and show methodmap structure. Notepad++ don't reacts on dots in names (exp: LineNumber.get) and docs not shown, so `.` were separated with `_` symbol.
>If you want to use string as code you must remove prefix and separate `_` with `.`  
>If you want to watch docs you must do the vice versa.

## Prefix structure:

| Type | With tag | Without tag |
|------| ------ | ------ |
| Constructor | METHODMAP_`%1`_`%2`\_CONSTRUCTOR\_`%3` | METHODMAP_`%1`\_CONSTRUCTOR_`%3` |
| Method | METHODMAP_`%1`_`%2`_METHOD\_`%3` | METHODMAP_`%1`\_METHOD_`%3` |
| Property | METHODMAP_`%1`_`%2`_PROP\_`%3` | METHODMAP_`%1`_PROP\_`%3` |

Where: `%1` - Class name, `%2` - Tag name, `%3` - Real method/property/constructor name.

**PREFIX** - Text before `%3` param (e.g., `METHODMAP_ArrayList_Handle_METHOD_`GetArray).

## Examples:

**String to watch docs:**  
Method: Clone  
Prefix: METHODMAP_ArrayList_Handle_METHOD_  
Result: METHODMAP_ArrayList_Handle_METHOD_Clone

**String to use as code:**  
Docs string: METHODMAP_ArrayStack_PROP_BlockSize_get  
Removes prefix: METHODMAP_ArrayStack_PROP_  
Result: my_code.BlockSize.get()
