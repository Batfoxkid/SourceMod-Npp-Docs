# Plugin for SourceMod developers
## About

Here the new API docs with all (I hope) function, define, enum, methodmap and fixed xml structure. Docs were generated by reworked generator plugin.

## Plugin features:
 - Generate auto-completion files
 - Generate inline docs (*sourcemod.xml*)
 - Supports SourceMod 1.7 API specifics
 
## New in v1.2:
 - Added xml filter
 - Added more console stats
 - Better way to detect commentary lines
 - Code optimization
 - Detect methodmap
 - Detect enum & define correctly
 - Detect all func params

## Server command:
**sm_makedocs** - starts to parse SourceMod includes and generates output files

## Methodmap notes:
![Docs screenshot](https://github.com/raziEiL/SourceMod-Npp-Docs/blob/master/img/img.png "Inline docs: methodmap strings")
These strings are not exist SourceMod function! Purpose of these strings provide access to docs and show methodmap structure. Notepad++ don't reacts on dots in names (exp: LineNumber.get) and docs not shown, so I replaced `.` with `_` symbol
>If you want to use string as code you must remove prefix and separate `_` with `.`  
>If you want to watch docs you must do the vice versa 

### Prefix structure:

| Type | With tag | Without tag |
|------| ------ | ------ |
| Constructor | METHODMAP_%1_%2_CONSTRUCTOR_%3 | METHODMAP_%1_CONSTRUCTOR_%3 |
| Method | METHODMAP_%1_%2_METHOD_%3 | METHODMAP_%1_METHOD_%3 |
| Property | METHODMAP_%1_%2_PROP_%3 | METHODMAP_%1_PROP_%3 |

Where: %1 - Class name, %2 - Tag name, %3 - Method/Property/Constructor name
>**PREFIX** - Text before Method/Property/Constructor name

### Examples:

**String to watch docs:**  
Method: Clone  
Prefix: METHODMAP_ArrayList_Handle_METHOD_  
Result: METHODMAP_ArrayList_Handle_METHOD_Clone

**String to use as code:**  
Docs: METHODMAP_ArrayStack_PROP_BlockSize_get  
Result: my_code.BlockSize.get()
